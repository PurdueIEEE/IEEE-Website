                    <p class="fs-3">
                        The Purdue IEEE SSO system is a way to unify any services committees use into a single login,
                        with a shared account used to authenticate into multiple hosted services. You use SSO logins
                        all the time at Purdue - BoilerKey is a type of SSO system used for Purdue University services.
                        Here at Purdue IEEE, we use a similar system, but customized to fit our needs.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">How do I create an account?</h2>
                    <p class="fs-3">
                        You only need to create an account if you need to use the SSO system for your committee. Once
                        you attempt to login, you will notice a login page labeled with "Purdue IEEE SSO". Click the
                        "Register" button on the bottom of the form to create an account. It will ask you some personal
                        information and to confirm your email. Once you do these steps, you're done!
