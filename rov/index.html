                                The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as
                                a committee within Purdue IEEE Student Organization in 2008 with a
                                small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's mission
                                is to foster technical and professional skills of its members by
                                designing, constructing, and testing an innovative underwater vehicle
                                to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.

                                The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students
                                working collaboratively on a hands-on project from the vehicle's design and
                                prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and ultimately competition
                                performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the best
                                ideas may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also
                                requires a professional presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.

                            <p class="fs-5">
                                Because the vehicle requires excellence in design, construction, and presentation, the
                                team members are themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and experts in their own discipline.
                                Members learn to communicate clearly with each other and with clients while managing their
                                own project responsibilities. Through various outreach events during the year, the team aims
                                to inspire future generations to enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.

                            Purdue ROV competed in Long Beach, CA at the 20th MATE World Championship.
                            After arriving in California, the team reassembled the robot that had been carefully
                            broken down and packaged for air travel. Over the next several days, though, the team
                            had to rush to repair the electronics stack after the hotel was struck by lightning
                            (yes, really). Luckily, with some Arduinos  bought nearby, the team was able to rewrite
                            new communications code from scratch in just two days. This effectively replaced the
                            functionality of our ESC interface boards that had stopped communicating properly with
                            the rest of the electronics stack.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">
                            The essential repairs were completed just in time for our last mission run. Overall,
                            we placed 10th internationally and 2nd in the engineering technical presentation! The
                            team left competition eager for next season, already working to plan our next vehicle.
                        </p>

                            The team, newly under the leadership of Peter Salisbury as captain, looks forward to
                            returning to the shop, digging into a new vehicle design, and welcoming new team members. See you on campus!
