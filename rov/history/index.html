                                Purdue ROV competed in Johnson City, TN at the East Tennessee State University from August 5th to 
                                August 7th. The team achieved 4th place in the Explorer category and won the Aloha Team Spirit Award. 
                                ROV Triton performed admirably at competition, piloting smoothly for both mission runs and the bonus. 
                                ROV Triton introduced numerous improvements: the integrated thruster ducts; modular foam and ballst 
                                system; a quick sealing logic tube; a resin printed solenoid manifold; a single box for power 
                                electronics providing ultimate accessibility, sealing, and thermal properties, hot swappable ESCs and 
                                controllers for them; ESC and power brick data; higher current output; ultra low latency camera 
                                streams; a more robust ROS network; and a modular front end. The team is very proud of its achievements 
                                and is excited to see what can be done in the upcoming season as Katherine Sandys takes over as the 
                                sixth captain of the team.

                            The 2019-2020 season marked an exciting and bustling new season for the team. The team experienced its fourth change 
                            in captaincy with Grant Geyer heading the team. Also new are many of the leads for the technical teams. The team pursued 
                            many new designs and approaches toward making X12, in addition to several refinements from ROV Remora. The R&D department 
                            found new ethernet cameras that were more reliable and PoE compatible for a nearly independent camera system. The 
                            major mechanical improvements include a faster and effective method of using a ring clamp to seal the logic electronics 
                            tube and the use of 3D prints to house thrusters and to provide buoyancy in conjuntion with expanding marine foam. 
                            With the suspension of all Purdue activities and the cancellation of the MATE competition, the team is now working at 
                            a very limited capacity to prepare ROV X12 for a pool test when available. The team is excited to see its hard work 
                            come to completion when normal activities resume.

                            The year 2019 marked an improvement for the team, with many leaders returning to their positions. The team improved 
                            5 places to finish 13th at the competition and had the second best technical report. The team maintained a similar 
                            size of students. In 2019, the competition was hosted in Kingsport, TN by Eastman. The team aimed for an ambitious 
                            design, changing the tools system to use pneumatics, the electrical system to CAN and ethernet cameras, and the software 
                            system to Robot Operating System. These switches made ROV Remora more robust, but delayed testing and made integration 
                            more difficult. The team is very proud of its achievements and excited to see where the upcoming season goes under 
                            the new leadership.

                            The team faced its third change in captaincy, with Alex Ruffino taking over. The team kept its large size, with more than 
                            50 people working on the project over the year. The competition moved to Seattle this year, and the team brought with them 
                            a strong technical report and presentation. Technical issues with the electronics prevented the team from reaching its 
                            full potential, but they kept trying to make the ROV function properly at both mission runs and the bonus point run. The 
                            team finished 18th out of 28, and was awarded the Guts and Glory award for overcoming technical hardship with resolve. 
                            The team is proud of their achievements, and looks forward to the upcoming season!
