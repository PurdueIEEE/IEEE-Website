                                The Purdue Aerial Robotics Team IEEE (PARTIEEE) was founded back in 1996 
                                as a committee within the Purdue IEEE Student Organization. The Purdue 
                                Aerial Robotics Team mission is to create an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) 
                                to compete in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International 
                                Student Unmanned Air Systems (AUVSI SUAS) Competition.

                                PARTIEEE consists of both engineering and non-engineering focuses. The 
                                engineering goals are to create mathematical and physical models, 
                                construct prototypes, and develop a final, mission-ready system. The 
                                non-engineering goals are to develop relationships with companies, encourage 
                                a collaborative work environment, communicate effectively with team members, 
                                and provide learning opportunities for students of any discipline and 
                                experience level. Achieving these goals will help us develop a UAS that 
                                meets the rigorous standards demanded by the competition, in order to 
                                succeed as a team.

                            worthwhile, modern experience on aircraft design. The team has a strong 
                            emphasis on system design and manufacturing practicality. A rigorous 
                            engineering approach is applied from structures and propulsion, with 
                            training to provide any necessary skills to students of all skill and

                            The electrical sub-team of PARTIEEE is responsible for designing and implementing 
                            the plane's embedded hardware and software systems. The goals of this sub-team are 
                            to develop a safe, efficient system capable of navigating and collecting data 
                            about its surrounding environment with minimal human intervention. Much of the 
                            work done by the electrical sub-team involves both hardware and software and 
                            falls into the areas of communications, flight controls, and autonomy.
                            <br><br>
                            Current projects include the development of custom flight control software, radio 
                            communications between the aircraft and its ground station, telemetry sensor data 
                            collection, creation of autonomous flight algorithms, and mission simulation design 
                            to rapidly validate and improve existing navigation algorithms. To accomplish these 
                            tasks, the plane is outfitted with various sensors including an IMU, airspeed sensor, 
                            and GPS, among others. It's software is written in C and Python.
                            <br><br>
                            The electrical sub-team strives to design and implement robust, professional solutions 
                            on board the UAV. We constantly research and improve to allow the UAV to perform to 
                            its maximum levels each year.

                            The software sub-team of PARTIEEE is responsible for designing and implementing the UAV's 
                            computer vision system. The goal of this sub-team is to develop a robust and accurate system 
                            which can identify multiple characteristics of various objects on the ground with minimal 
                            human intervention.
                            <br><br>
                            The software sub-team works with image processing libraries, such as openCV, to filter incoming 
                            pictures and extract necessary data. More recently, the team has also incorporated machine learning 
                            libraries to increase detection accuracy. The team is tasked with identifying targets from the air 
                            and numerous characteristics about these targets including shape, color, alphanumeric values, and 
                            location. Additionally, there exists a communication system between the aircraft camera and the 
                            ground station. The team runs some of its algorithms on board the aircraft, but the majority 
                            are processed on the ground via the communication system.
                            <br><br>
                            Our team is committed to pushing the limits of current technology and computer science. 
                            So, the team's current, year-long goal is to create a computer vision system as well as 
                            an image database to identify these targets with high amounts of accuracy. Our work this 
                            year is starting from the ground up and will set the team up for success for many years 
                            to come.
