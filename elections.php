                    Statements</h1>  
                    <b>Jessica Chin -- President Candidate</b><br>
                    <p>Hi! I am Jessica Chin, and I am a sophomore in Electrical Engineering. I am currently the Vice President and I was the secretary the semester before. I am running to be the President of the Purdue IEEE Student Branch. As president, my mission is to improve the communication amongst the different committees, to encourage people to get involved in IEEE, and to enable members of IEEE to achieve their goals. I strive to create an environment where there is unity within IEEE. In addition, I also want to pursue collaboration with other organizations on campus and to engage in more in outreach event. Thus, I feel with my experience and vision I will be able to help the Purdue IEEE Student grow as President.</p>

                    <b>Melchor De La Garza -- Secretary Candidate</b> <br>
                    <p>I want to serve on the IEEE executive committee as Secretary because I have the skills to communicate effectively across our members, the discipline to meet deadlines, and the aptitude to be a strong leader. As a member of this organization, I’ve had the privilege of getting to know some of you whom I've been able to share moments with and experience opportunities of growth. My aim as Secretary is to nurture the development of these opportunities across all platforms of IEEE. It has been a pleasure to work alongside colleagues whom have made my experience as an IEEE member worthwhile. The experience and indispensable knowledge gained from this organization is more than words can say, and I thank all of you for allowing me to grow as an individual. I strive to maintain order and communication, and ensure all future members are welcomed just as I was, by maintaining a congenial atmosphere to work in.</p>

                    <b>Jason King -- Learning Chair Candidate </b> <br>
                    <p> I have been an active member of IEEE the last 3 years on the ROV committee, where I have been on the software and electrical teams. Last year I was the cameras and sensors project lead on ROV, and this year I was the electrical team lead, which I will continue to be next year. I have been programming for 8 years, soldering for 6, and using eagle for over 2 years. I have also led all four of the soldering training sessions this year and assisted with teaching the EAGLE and github workshops, so I have a very good understanding of what is required in executing an informative and useful workshop.
                    As a member for the last 3 years I have developed numerous connections with extremely technically knowledgeable members of IEEE who will be able to lead learning workshops throughout next year. I will continue to improve Code Café while expanding collaboration with other professional organizations to improve learning and increase knowledge for all people at Purdue.
                    I want to run for leading chair because I know that I have the experience and expertise to train both new and returning members of IEEE, as well as members of collaborating organizations, so that everyone who attends will learn new and applicable skills to their project teams, classes, and careers." </p>

                    <b>Gavin Shanley  -- Treasurer </b> <br>
                    <p> I want to serve as Treasurer of the IEEE Executive Committee because I have worked in finance for three years. Currently I hold the title of Vice Chair of Software Saturdays and although I have only been an IEEE member for a short time I want to do what I can to preserve and facilitate the numerous opportunities offered to Purdue students through this organization. I plan to achieve this by managing well balanced books and managing the funds that allow for exciting new opportunities and experiences for all members.</p>

                    <b>Erik VanderWerf  -- Vice President and Secretary </b> <br>
                    <p> <b> Vice President: </b> <br> 
                    I would be a good vice president of IEEE because of my wide experience within the club. I spent my first year at IEEE as a member of ROV. From there I transitioned to Aerial Robotics, where I have remained and am currently serving as the Vice President of the committee. This year as Aerial Vice Captain I have gained experience in talking to companies and other organizations, and was able to secure funding from the school of ECE for the committee. </p>
                    <p>Apart from my cornerstone involvement, I have also been a member of the Industrial Relations committee, where I have been working to bring speakers to campus and organize alumni talks on campus. I am also a mentor for the brand new Software Saturdays, and am teaching students all over campus how to create a web server. I feel these experiences have prepared me to step up for both the administrative and event planning responsibilities of the vice presidency.</p>
                    <p>I want to run for vice president because I want IEEE to continue to be one of the best organizations to be a part of on campus. I will focus on fostering communication between the technical and non-technical committees. There are so many ways for students to get involved in something in IEEE that will prepare them for the future, and I want to be there to make it happen. </p>   
                    <p><b> Secretary: </b> <br>
                    I would make a good secretary for IEEE because of my experience in web development and my communication skills. The IEEE website is in need of some love, and I look forward to completing the modifications that are currently in progress by our current secretary. I have been a member of many of the committees that IEEE runs, which means that I know where to go and who to talk to while I am organizing the IEEE calendar and cross-committee communication. As an engineer, I know a thing or two about loopholes and prepositional logic, which means that I will be able to effectively propose changes to the IEEE constitution using wording that is clear and unambiguous. </p>
                    <p> I want to run for secretary because I want IEEE to continue to be one of the best organizations on campus. I will focus on getting the word about IEEE events out to the community, and work with the vice president to make the general assemblies better than ever.
                    </p>

                    <b>Rebecca Chow -- Learning Chair and Social Chair </b> <br>
                    <p> <b>Learning Chair: </b> <br>
                    The reason that I want to become the learning chair is to help students not only to enjoy their time and be successful at Purdue but also be prepared for their future after graduation. I personally understand the feeling of being overwhelmed when first entering Purdue and how much I wish that there were more resources out there to help me learn the necessary technical and soft skills. I was very lucky to join Purdue IEEE Industrial Relations committee during my junior year in  Fall 2017, and since then I have become an administrator of Software Saturdays, where I am assisting students learning programming throughout the semester. These experiences and skills have helped me become a more well-rounded person and I would like to pass those on to students at Purdue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For me, the goal of being the learning chair is to understand students' needs and provide resources corresponding with their needs. There are many programs that the Learning Committee is currently running that I would like to keep, like Code Cafe, soldering workshops, resume workshops, and interview workshops. A program that I would like to see implemented is inter-committee learning events, where members from a committee would teach attendees something that falls under the expertise of that committee, as a way of encouraging inter-committee socialization. I have so many ideas that I want to explore. However, I also want to keep myself open to other options as we think of needs within the student body to fill!
                    </p>   
                    <p><b> Social Chair: </b> <br>
                    The reason that I want to become the social chair is to help Purdue IEEE members get more engaged with each other and attract new members by hosting events to help them understand better of Purdue IEEE. I would like to organize couple events that provide an environment for members to know more about each other such as focuses, culture, language, and hobbies that Purdue IEEE is a place to foster greater relationship and to meet new people . A lot of freshman coming to Purdue without knowing anyone, and it is a struggling process to make new friends. I have couple ideas in mind to create an atmosphere that will attract students to hangout with the members and to learn more about expertise under each technical  committee. This provides students a great opportunity to have new friendships and appreciate what Purdue IEEE does as a student organization at Purdue. I will keep myself open to any ideas that can help promote stronger bonding between members and attract new members to Purdue IEEE family!
                    </p>
                    
                    <b>Eric Sibley -- Social Chair</b> <br>
                    <p> As a potential social chair, I would seek to close any divides present between both IEEE organizations and subcommittees. To facilitate an environment that fosters more of a community spirit, we IEEE must grow close as a whole, and the best way to grow these bonds is through social events, where we can all become friends before getting back to work together. I firmly believe that to maximize our work output and efficiency we must all work as a collective unit, so as social chair I would work to make sure that everyone feels invited to participate in a wide variety of events that will boost our collective morale and keep us all in high spirits. </p>

                    <b>Jacob Cottrell  -- Industrial Relations Chair </b> <br>
                    <p> IEEE is one of the most organized and professional student organizations I have had the pleasure of being a part of, and I want to play a role in maintaining that level of professionalism and esteem by bringing in corporate sponsors and speakers to interact with members. I joined IEEE in spring of 2017 as a member of the basestation team in the ROV committee and more recently became a member of the PARTIEEE committee, within which I mostly worked with the sponsorship sub-committee to acquire funding and material donations for the team. I want to take that role a step further in becoming the Industrial Relations Chair for IEEE to continue bringing professional opportunities and career building events to members by using both previously existing connections as well as my own connections to multiple departments on campus. I believe I have both the relevant experience and relevant connections necessary to successfully facilitate and lead the IEEE industrial relations committee to fruition.
                    </p>

                    <b>Ellie Topi  -- Vice President and Growth and Engagement Chair </b> <br>
                    <p> <b> Vice President: </b> <br>
                    As the current Aerial Captain, I’m looking to take my experience and IEEE involvement to the next level by running for VP. I pride myself on my ability to effectively organize people, and hope to bring that ability to IEEE at large by promoting communication and interaction between the committees, maintaining oversight over the committees, and helping the President out. Enabling the smooth functioning of IEEE is a top priority.</p>

                    <p> <b> Growth and Engagement Chair: </b> <br>
                    I’m currently the G&E Chair, and have prided myself on formalizing recruiting and outreach efforts. By placing a special effort on finding and recruiting more specialized members for our technical committees. I’ve also made outreach with our local community a higher priority. I hope to continue this effort next year.</p>
