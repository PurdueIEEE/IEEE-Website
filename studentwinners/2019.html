                                Worked overtime to ensure his members learned new techniques and took it upon himself to deliver
                                a fantastic exterior design! Thanks Ryan!</p>

                            <p class="fs-5">Our second student of the week is Jonathan Heidegger, is a sophomore studying Computer
                                Science with a minor in German from Brownsburg, IN. Jonathan joined the team in Spring 2019 and dove
                                into the software development. He picked up on the ROV environment quickly and wrote several of the
                                sensor nodes. For the current school year, Jonathan has tested multiple thruster control algorithms
                                and tracked the dataflow and connection systemwide between the pilot's controller and the physical
                                outputs on the ROV. Jonathan has been helpful getting members started in ROS and getting the ROV
                                into a reliable, working state. Outside of ROV, he plays tenor saxophone in the Purdue All-American
                                Marching band and in the Men's basketball pep band. He is a FIRST alum and a member of Purdue FIRST
                                Programs helping coordinate the competition events on the regional team.</p>
