                                The Purdue Aerial Robotics Team  was founded back in 1996
                                as a committee within the Purdue IEEE Student Organization. The Purdue
                                Aerial Robotics Team mission is to create an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)
                                to compete in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International
                                Student Unmanned Air Systems (AUVSI SUAS) Competition.

                                PART consists of both engineering and non-engineering focuses. The
                                engineering goals are to create mathematical and physical models,
                                construct prototypes, and develop a final, mission-ready system. The
                                non-engineering goals are to develop relationships with companies, encourage
                                a collaborative work environment, communicate effectively with team members,
                                and provide learning opportunities for students of any discipline and
                                experience level. Achieving these goals will help us develop a UAS that
                                meets the rigorous standards demanded by the competition, in order to
                                succeed as a team.

                            The AeroMechanical sub-team of Purdue Aerial Robotics Team designs,
                            builds, and tests a safe, mission effective platform for the AUVSI
                            SUAS competition. The sub-team's goal is to provide team members a
                            worthwhile, modern experience on aircraft design. The team has a strong
                            emphasis on system design and manufacturing practicality. A rigorous
                            engineering approach is applied from structures and propulsion, with
                            training to provide any necessary skills to students of all skill and
                            experience levels. FEA and CFD techniques are utilized along with traditional
                            analysis and testing. Our designs are built around expertise in composites
                            manufacturing, supported by precise 3D printed molds, to provide an efficient
                            airframe while mirroring the ongoing changes in the industry.

                        <p>
                            The electrical sub-team of PART is responsible for designing and implementing
                            the plane's embedded hardware and software systems. The goals of this sub-team are
                            to develop a safe, efficient system capable of navigating and collecting data
                            about its surrounding environment with minimal human intervention. Much of the
                            work done by the electrical sub-team involves both hardware and software and
                            falls into the areas of communications, flight controls, and autonomy.
                            <br><br>
                            Current projects include the development of custom flight control software, radio
                            communications between the aircraft and its ground station, telemetry sensor data
                            collection, creation of autonomous flight algorithms, and mission simulation design
                            to rapidly validate and improve existing navigation algorithms. To accomplish these
                            tasks, the plane is outfitted with various sensors including an IMU, airspeed sensor,
                            and GPS, among others. It's software is written in C and Python.
                            <br><br>
                            The electrical sub-team strives to design and implement robust, professional solutions
                            on board the UAV. We constantly research and improve to allow the UAV to perform to
                            its maximum levels each year.

                            The software sub-team of PART is responsible for designing and implementing the UAV's
                            computer vision system. The goal of this sub-team is to develop a robust and accurate system
                            which can identify multiple characteristics of various objects on the ground with minimal
                            human intervention.
                            <br><br>
                            The software sub-team works with image processing libraries, such as openCV, to filter incoming
                            pictures and extract necessary data. More recently, the team has also incorporated machine learning
                            libraries to increase detection accuracy. The team is tasked with identifying targets from the air
                            and numerous characteristics about these targets including shape, color, alphanumeric values, and
                            location. Additionally, there exists a communication system between the aircraft camera and the
                            ground station. The team runs some of its algorithms on board the aircraft, but the majority
                            are processed on the ground via the communication system.
                            <br><br>
                            Our team is committed to pushing the limits of current technology and computer science.
                            So, the team's current, year-long goal is to create a computer vision system as well as
                            an image database to identify these targets with high amounts of accuracy. Our work this
                            year is starting from the ground up and will set the team up for success for many years
                            to come.
