                                For this semester MTT-S is creating a radar system for the Spin Scooters using the Acconeer's XM122 Radar sensors.
                                The intent of this radar system is to display obstacles in the rider's blind spots and notify them before a collision occurs.
                                The radar sensor will detect objects within 5 meters of the XM122 radar sensor and then objects will be displayed on
                                an LCD screen, once the radar is too close to an obstacle, the buzzer and LED will signal the rider to be careful and
                                slow down. We hope that through this project, the members of MTT-S would be able to understand how microwave signals
                                are received and transmitted using the radar sensors and display as well as gain more knowledge about microprocessors
                                and its functionality. Furthermore, this project hopes to decrease the number of scooter accidents on campus. In future
                                semesters if the club wishes to continue building the radar system, we hope to have a similar implementation for bicycles
                                and even for cars.

                            In addition to working on the power amplifier and wireless harvester to prepare for IMS (International Microwave Symposium),
                            we worked on an electromagnetically powered projectile launcher. This involved three main tasks including circuit design, mechanical design,
                            and CAD design. We also worked on a FM radio workshop where we designed PCB and worked with radio signal logics to make personal FM radios.

                            Purdue IEEE MTT-S spent the year focusing on competing for a second time in a row at the area's largest conference, IMS
                            (International Microwave Symposium), in their student design competitions. Moreover, the officers as well as some of the more-involved
                            members spent the fall semester developing a workshop for an FM transmitter. This included tasks such as circuit design, PCB layout,
                            and documentation. Every Thursday, members learned about various topics such as classes of power amplifiers, modulation schemes, and RF
                            front end components. Knowledge gained on these topics will help out as the club prepares to compete in the IMS student design competitions
                            next summer. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bBvMSWGK2I" target="_blank">Check out our demo video!</a>
