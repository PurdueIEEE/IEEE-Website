                                being the latest.
                                Ivan has been a huge boost to the ROV team. He took over the front end this year and has done an
                                excellent job integrating it with ros so it's easy to use. Ivan had compiled extensive documentation
                                to create a tutorial for installing ROS. His work for the front end has also included a 3D model of
                                the ROV with orientation, thruster visualization, and more.</p>
