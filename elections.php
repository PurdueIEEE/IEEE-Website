                    Statements</h1>  

                    <b>Melchor De La Garza -- Secretary Candidate</b> <br>
                    <p>I want to serve on the IEEE executive committee as Secretary because I have the skills to communicate effectively across our members, the discipline to meet deadlines, and the aptitude to be a strong leader. As a member of this organization, I’ve had the privilege of getting to know some of you whom I've been able to share moments with and experience opportunities of growth. My aim as Secretary is to nurture the development of these opportunities across all platforms of IEEE. It has been a pleasure to work alongside colleagues whom have made my experience as an IEEE member worthwhile. The experience and indispensable knowledge gained from this organization is more than words can say, and I thank all of you for allowing me to grow as an individual. I strive to maintain order and communication, and ensure all future members are welcomed just as I was, by maintaining a congenial atmosphere to work in.</p>


                    <b>Jason King -- Learning Chair Candidate </b> <br>
                    <p> I have been an active member of IEEE the last 3 years on the ROV committee, where I have been on the software and electrical teams. Last year I was the cameras and sensors project lead on ROV, and this year I was the electrical team lead, which I will continue to be next year. I have been programming for 8 years, soldering for 6, and using eagle for over 2 years. I have also led all four of the soldering training sessions this year and assisted with teaching the EAGLE and github workshops, so I have a very good understanding of what is required in executing an informative and useful workshop.
                    As a member for the last 3 years I have developed numerous connections with extremely technically knowledgeable members of IEEE who will be able to lead learning workshops throughout next year. I will continue to improve Code Café while expanding collaboration with other professional organizations to improve learning and increase knowledge for all people at Purdue.
                    I want to run for leading chair because I know that I have the experience and expertise to train both new and returning members of IEEE, as well as members of collaborating organizations, so that everyone who attends will learn new and applicable skills to their project teams, classes, and careers." </p>
