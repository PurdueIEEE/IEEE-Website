                                The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as
                                a committee within Purdue IEEE Student Organization in 2008 with a
                                small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's mission
                                is to foster technical and professional skills of its members by
                                designing, constructing, and testing an innovative underwater vehicle
                                to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.

                                The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students
                                working collaboratively on a hands-on project from the vehicle's design and
                                prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and ultimately competition
                                performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the best
                                ideas may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also
                                requires a professional presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.

                                Because the vehicle requires excellence in design, construction, and presentation, the
                                team members are themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and experts in their own discipline.
                                Members learn to communicate clearly with each other and with clients while managing their
                                own project responsibilities. Through various outreach events during the year, the team aims
                                to inspire future generations to enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.

                            Purdue ROV competed in Longmont, CO at the 21th MATE World Championship. After an arduous, 15 hour drive, the team reconvened at the hotel to prepare for a week of mission runs, technical presentations, and late night modifications. During the first mission run, our primary camera failed, but undeterred, our intrepid pilot Bryce Sasser still managed to complete several mission tasks! The cameras were brought back online during the last 5 seconds of the run, but Armed with new knowledge, we set out to make all the necessary adjustments and prepare for our second and final mission run. The second run went seamlessly! The ROV piloted effortlessly, and the team scored 125 points in the mission run, narrowly losing out on second place due to a leak sprung in our external float.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">
                            Thanks to the dedication and perseverance of our members and leadership, the team placed 6th overall in the explorer class! We look forward to the upcoming season where, under the leadership of Zachary Neel as captain, we will build on the lessons learned with X15 ISO-Squid.
