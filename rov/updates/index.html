                        Purdue ROV competed in Johnson City, TN at the East Tennessee State University from August 5th to 
                        August 7th. The team achieved 4th place in the Explorer category and won the Aloha Team Spirit Award. 
                        ROV Triton performed admirably at competition, piloting smoothly for both mission runs and the bonus. 
                        The team is very proud of its achievements and is excited to see what can be done in the upcoming 
                        season as Katherine Sandys takes over as captain.

                        After a unique year of meetings with covid precautions and a half completed vehicle to be finished, the 
                        team has qualified for the 2021 MATE World Competition! Grant Geyer guided the team through the many 
                        shifts and sought to consolidate designs for reliability, technical challenge, and feasbility. Several 
                        innovations were introduced such as a resin printed pneumatic manifold, a USB borescope camera system, 
                        and continual improvements. The team looks forward to continuing its frequent pool tests and practicing 
                        as much as possible before the competition. Next year, Katherine Sandys will head the team and lead it 
                        to new innovations and achievements.

                        The 2020-2021 season marks a unique season for the team as they try to continue operations during the 
                        COVID-19 pandemic. Heading into this season, the team experienced change with several of the leads for 
                        technical teams assuming their role for the first time. The team has taken the foundation of X12 that 
                        was constructed the prior season before the suspension and is building upon that to create the next 
                        iteration of the ROV, X13. Two of the main improvements planned for X13 are a more accessible yet 
                        powerful electronics design utilizing Power over Ethernet and a software system leveraging more powerful 
                        hardware for a more capable ROV. This season we have two prominent R&D projects with the development 
                        of custom thrusters, rather than relying on the narrow choice presented by Blue Robotics and the development 
                        of welded enclosures aimed at improving resource efficiency. While there are still restrictions in place 
                        at Purdue that alter the progress of the ROV, the team is continuing to progress while ensuring that theyâ€™re 
                        following all Protect Purdue guidelines to maintain a safe working environment. The team is proud of its 
                        progress so far and is excited to see its hard work take form.

                    <p class="fs-5">
                        The 2019-2020 season marked an exciting and bustling new season for the team. The team experienced its fourth 
                        change in captaincy with Grant Geyer heading the team. Also new are many of the leads for technical teams. 
                        The team pursued many new designs and approaches toward making X12, in addition to several refinements from 
                        ROV Remora. The R&D department found new ethernet cameras that were more reliable and PoE compatible for an 
                        nearly independent camera system. The major mechanical improvements include a faster and effective method of 
                        using a ring clamp to seal the logic electronics tube and the use of 3D prints to house thrusters and to provide 
                        buoyancy in conjuntion with expanding marine foam. With the suspension of all Purdue activities and the 
                        cancellation of the MATE competition, the team is now working at a very limited capacity to prepare ROV X12 
                        for a pool test when available. The team is excited to see its hard work come to completion when normal 
                        activities resume.

                    <p class="fs-5">
                        The year 2019 marked an improvement for the team, with many leaders returning to their positions. The team 
                        improved 5 places to finish 13th at the competition and had the second best technical report. The team maintained 
                        a similar size of students. In 2019, the competition was hosted in Kingsport, TN by Eastman. The team aimed 
                        for an ambitious design, changing the tools system to use pneumatics, the electrical system to CAN and ethernet 
                        cameras, and the software system to Robot Operating System. These switches made ROV Remora more robust, 
                        but delayed testing and made integration more difficult. The team is very proud of its achievements and 
                        excited to see where the upcoming season goes under the new leadership.
