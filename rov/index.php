                    The year 2019 marked an improvement for the team, which many leaders returning to their positions.
                    The team maintained a similar size of students and improved 5 places to finish 13th at the MATE competition and had the second best technical report.
                    The team aimed for an ambitious design, changing the tools system to use pneumatics, the electrical system to CAN and ethernet cameras,
                    and the software system to Robot Operating System. These switches made ROV Remora more robust, but delayed testing and made integration more difficult.
                    The team is very proud of its achievements and excited to see where the upcoming season goes under the new leadership.

            <p class="text-justify">
                The Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) team was founded as a committee within Purdue IEEE
                Student Organization in 2008 with a small but dedicated group of five students. Today, the team's
                mission is to foster technical and professional skills of its members by designing, constructing, and
                testing an innovative underwater vehicle to compete in the MATE Center International ROV Competition.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The ROV team is comprised of both engineering and non-engineering students working collaboratively on a
                hands-on project from the vehicle's design and prototyping phase, to its construction and testing, and
                ultimately competition performance. The team fosters a multidisciplinary spirit so that the best ideas
                may come forth. In addition to the mission, the MATE competition also requires a professional
                presentation, public display poster, and technical documentation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Because the vehicle requires excellence in design, construction, and presentation, the team members are
                themselves multidisciplinary collaborators and experts in their own discipline. Members learn to
                communicate clearly with each other and with clients while managing their own project responsibilities.
                Through various outreach events during the year, the team aims to inspire future generations to enter
                STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
